### [Machine Learning Application to Biochemical Kinetics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10504344)

A machine learning framework called Nessie is applied to some notable biochemical systems to
generate the marginal probabilities that describe the evolution of those systems over time.

### Improving Metagenome Assembly Scaffolding With Machine Learning


The project aims to determine machine learning approaches that can outperform the current heuristics in MetaHipMer (MHM). The learning approach can be integrated into the MHM pipeline in future work to offer improved assembly quality to all MHM users, with beneficial results for microbiome work, depending on the metagenome assembly.

### Method of Moments for Approximating Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Receptor Models

We apply the method of moments to the VEGF receptor model, which describes the role of VEGF in the regulation of blood vessel formation
and growth through a series of molecular interactions between VEGF and its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. The method’s accuracy
is evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained from the stochastic simulation algorithm and the chemical Langevin equation. The VEGF model is of interest because of the role of VEGF in the growth of cancer and other inflammatory diseases and the potential use of anti-VEGF therapies in the treatment of cancer.
