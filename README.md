### Improving Metagenome Assembly Scaffolding With Machine Learning


The project is set to determine machine learning approaches that can outperform the current heuristics in MetaHipMer (MHM). The learning approach can, in future work, be integrated into the MHM pipeline to offer improved assembly quality to all MHM users, with beneficial results for microbiome work depending on metagenome assembly.
